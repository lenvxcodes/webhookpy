# webhookpy
python3 webhook with custom things!

# How web.json works?
- u can set ur own names. not src always. Thats up to u.

# Modifying config.json is easy.
- set ur own things.
- u can set hello and bye messages as NULL without "" to not send them
# Commands:
 ```
*FIND + Fore.RESET}.prefix - prints out ur prefix.*
**prefix.logout - logs out and prints ur bye message, if is it null it does not print.**
**prefix.range - spams, "u can get ip banned -ari" stay safe.**
**prefix.src - if u want to print out my github link to webhook.py**
**prefix.help - for list of the commands**
**prefix.pic - Sends a file. in files folder.**
