# How web.json works?
- u can set ur own names. not src always. Thats up to u.

# Modifying config.json is easy.
- set ur own things.
- u can set hello and bye messages as NULL without "" to not send them
# Commands:
 ```
 FIND.preifx - prints out ur prefix.
 urprefix.logout - logs out and prints ur bye message, if is it null it does not print.
 urpreifx.range - spams, "u can get ip banned -ari" stay safe.
 urprefix.src - if u want to print out my github link to webhook.py
 urprefix.quit - quits the script with bye message,
